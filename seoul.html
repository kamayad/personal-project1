    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I got accepted into Korea University as an international transfer student, so I went to Seoul to study for two years. I was supposed to graduate from KU but due to many factors I wasn't able to complete my degree. I didn't love the school life but I had a really good time living in Seould because of the abundance of places to explore, as well as the vegan cafes and restaurants.
    </p>
    <h2>Restaurants</h2>
    <p>It's surprising how many vagan restaurants there are in Seoul.</p>
    <h2>Cafes</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite things to do during the weekends or any time I had time off was going cafe hopping!</p?
    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>Outside of Seoul, I went to Ansan, Jeju-do, and Busan</p>
    <h2>Attractions</h2>
    <p>The best part about living in Seoul is the convenient and cheap public transportation</p>
