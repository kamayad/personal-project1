    <p>I got accepted into Korea University as an international transfer student, so I went to Seoul to study for two years. I was supposed to graduate from KU but due to many factors I wasn't able to complete my degree there. I didn't love the school life but I had a really good time living in Seould because of the abundance of places to explore, as well as the vegan cafes and restaurants.
